      <p class="intro-text">
        This webpage was created to explore the different resources available the top three counties in New York
        that have most number of libraries. In fact, at the time that this data was collected, Suffolk County had the most
        number of libraries within any county in the United States. &#128218;	
        <br>
        <br>
        The data was used throughout this project was gathered from the U.S. Census Bureau is the data collection agent for IMLS Public Libraries Survey.
        This data is from 2014. Future goal would be to update this webpage to include more recent data collection regarding the counties' libraries and 
        explore that changes that have occurred. 

        <br>
        <br>
        You can explore the different counties by changing the library selection right below! The default library selection is SUFFOLK county.

        The map below provides a visualization of the location of where the counties are on the 
        map of New York as well as where each of the libraries are located. If you hover over any point,
        you can learn information the library that includes the library's name, employee hours and number of librarians. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The number of librarians is calculated based off of the number of librarians per 25,000 within the service area population.  
        The number of Employee hours is the total number of hours of all the employees within a pay period (2 weeks).

        Let's take a look at the collections each library has! The number of collections and the variablity 
        within the types of the collections that are available can indicate the library's service population as
        a larger population leads to more funding, so more money can be splurged onto different collections 	&#128513;.

        You’ve completed your exploration of libraries with different counties in the state of New York! You’ve had a chance to look at different trends that were noticeable and possibly draw conclusions as to why these trends were present, whether because of county population or service population. Since this dataset is from 2014, the next step that would need to be done is to look at how these trends change over time and plot out the present trends of libraries in New York during the year of 2023.
